## Prerequisite

This is a collection of configuration files. To use them, ensure the required technologies are installed on your machine. For example, if you want to use my `.zshrc` configuration, make sure `zsh` is installed. I wonâ€™t cover how to install these technologies, please refer to their official documentation or GitHub pages for installation instructions.

ðŸš§ <strong>Disclaimer</strong>

This configuration is not intended to be a standalone setup. This repository was originally created as a personal archive, so some configurations may depend on others or on specific plugins. Applying them as-is might result in errors. Use at your own risk.

## Usage

You can clone this repository and extract the configurations you need, or simply navigate to the folder of the desired configuration, view the file in raw format, and copy the config manually.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:fransjesky/dotfiles.git
cd ~/dotfiles
```

I use [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin) theme for most of my configurations, If you want the same look, you'll need to install it. Otherwise, feel free to remove or replace it with your preferred theme.
